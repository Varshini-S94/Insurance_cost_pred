Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing and better risk management.

On doing exploratory data analysis, we've found out major factors which could influence the final premium price, using those factors, an "Insurance Cost Prediction" app is created.
